# H1  This will be a quick login page setup that will be functioning using docker, to run this, you can either run it locally with your xamp setup, or you can use the preset docker file.
To build the docker file, all you need to do is type docker-compose up --build -d or without the -d flag if you want the container to stay live in your terminal.

After running that, you are ready to interact with everything.
